Jourapp
=======

this is a small journaling app, similar to that of 750words.

In my case I put it locally on Raspberry pi, no password at the momement but I intend to make some auth soon.

The idea is simple: write min 750 words every day. To do that you will need some motivation and this app intends to do just that. It will count no of words you have written and give you nice popup when you suceeded.

I like to backup my stuff, so it will dropbox your database when you close the app.

There will be some stats provided, so you can know how well you are doing, please help my app by creating some pretty badges :))

Technical info
-----

This is python Flask app, with lots of Coffescript beauty. There is also simple SQLite DB behind, doing all the hard work. It will be backuped to Dropbox.
